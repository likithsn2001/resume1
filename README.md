Hiring Manager, Ontum Education

Dear Ms/Mrs Reader,
I am writing to express my interest in the company hiring program with your startup company. I learned about your company through the student center at my university and, after visiting your website, I have immersed myself in your groundbreaking work in the transportation industry.
Currently persuing EEE in CMRIT, with a minor in electrical, I will receive my degree next spring. While I have a comprehensive Technical and coding background. I feel that your company places prominence in similar areas and having the privilege of serving as an intern with you will increase my learning opportunities and give me the exposure I need to advance my career while using what I've already learned to make an impact on your company growth.
Sincerely,



Likith SN
